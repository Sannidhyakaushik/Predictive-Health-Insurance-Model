Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a Predictive Health Insurance Premium Model for Shield Insurance.

The objective is to estimate health insurance premiums based on applicant attributes such as:

Age

BMI

Smoking habits

Medical history

Lifestyle factors

The solution includes a high-accuracy ML model and a deployed Streamlit web application accessible to insurance underwriters.

🎯 Business Objective

Accurately predict insurance premiums

Improve underwriting efficiency

Enable remote cloud-based access

Reduce manual quote processing time

Prepare for future Straight Through Processing (STP)
